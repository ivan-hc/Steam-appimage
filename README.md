This repository provides the script to create an experimental portable version of Steam and an AppImage package ready to be tested each time we improve it.

It is built from the official .deb package, so it works like a standalone binary file.

# NOTE: requires 32-bit libraries installed on your system!

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
